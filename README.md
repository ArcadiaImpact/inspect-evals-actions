# Inspect Evals Actions

This repository hosts some of the **CI/CD workflows** for [Inspect Evals](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_evals/tree/main).  

It is designed to:

- Run the main build and test pipelines in a controlled environment  
- Provide faster or more stable runners than the upstream repo  

> Note: This repo does **not contain source code of the tests**. It only contains workflows for managing the testing of evals in Inspect Evals.
